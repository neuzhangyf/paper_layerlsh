In this paper, we present the layered version of LSH variants by exploring the density of hash values. The dense buckets are rehashed and the sparse buckets are merged in order to make the hashing more targeted in terms of data distribution. Based on this idea, we rebuild the basic LSH, LSB, and DSH, and propose LayerLSH, LayerLSB, and LayerDSH for illustration. We also discuss the possibilities of rebuilding other LSH variants and demonstrate the benefit in distributed computing. The experimental studies have shown their effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, LayerLSH can reach the same search quality as LSH with only 5\%-20\% query cost.
